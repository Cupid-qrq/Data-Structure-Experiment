### *This repository contains four systems implemented using' C/Cpp，submitted as assignments for the Data Structure course.*

- *Sequential Storage Structure Linear List Management System*
- *Linked Storage Structure Linear List Management System*
- *Binary Tree Management System Based on Binary Linked List*
- *Graph Management System Based on Adjacency List*

---
### 4.28 update log
- Added *Binary Tree Management System*, implemented based on a binary linked list.
- Optimized and improved the previous code, fixed known issues, and enhanced system stability and performance.

---
### 5.21 update log
- Added *Graph Management System*, implemented based on an adjacency list.
- The binary tree system has been fully modified and debugged,and known problems in four system have been fixed, and the system's stability and performance have been enhanced.
- Using more advanced C++ features, such as STL and smart pointers, to improve code quality and maintainability.
- So far, all data structure systems have been completed.The experiment report written by *LaTeX* will be submitted soon. 

### 5.27 update log
- Improved the code quality of the graph management system, fixed some bugs, and optimized the code structure.
- Added the experiment report written in *LaTeX* format, which includes detailed explanations of the design and implementation of each system.
- The whole project has been thoroughly finished.
